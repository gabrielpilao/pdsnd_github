### Project Title
Bike share project

### Description
The bike share project consisted on building a program that could interact with any outside user and provide him/her with the information about the use of shared bikes in the cities of washington, chicago and new york. Among other information, the program should be able to tell most used start and end station, sum of the time people travelled, the most frequent day of the week to travel.

### Files used
chicago.csv
washington.csv
new_york_city.csv

### Credits
I wouldn't have been able to conclude this project with out the information available on stack overflow and without the feedback of the udacity team on each of my deliveries.
